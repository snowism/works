          <h5>Project Overview</h5>
          <p>
            The client, Milse has been established in 2013 at Britomart in New
            Zealand as the city’s first dessert-only fine dining restaurant.
            Milse does not have their own webpage at the moment. It means they
            do not have to offer any services like booking a table or ordering
            food through the internet. Nowadays, as the technology has been
            developing, conducting digital marketing and providing service by
            any devices have strong key points for running business. This
            project making their own application to be implemented design and
            functions will help to achieve their business goals.
